//Interface:

// In an inheritance,you can't instantiate variable and create an object.
//The interface cannot contain concrete(with implemetation) methods
//In Interface onle one specifier is used-Public.


//A java class can implement multiple java interface. it is necessary that the class must implement all the methods declared in
//class should override all the abstract metods declared in the interface.
//The interface allows sending a message to an object without concerning which classes it belong.
//Class needs to provide functionally for the methods declared in the interface
//ALL methods in an interface are implicity public and abstract
//An interface canot be instantiated
//An interface reference can point to objects of its implementing classes
